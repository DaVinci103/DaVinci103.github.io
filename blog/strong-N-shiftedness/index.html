  <h1>Strong N-Shiftedness</h1>

  <a href="../..">&sol;..</a>

  <p>
    Hi~! Strong N-shiftedness is an ordinal notation I made. It's based on <a href="https://googology.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:TrialPurpleCube/Definition_of_LOCF">LOCF</a> and is intended to reach the proof theoretic ordinal of Z<sub>2</sub>! In this blog, I'll be explaining how it works :3
  </p>

  <p>
    An ordinal notation is, as the name suggest, a notation for ordinals :P. Ordinal numbers are basically an extension of the naturals, 0, 1, 2, 3, etc, with infinities, like ω, ω+1, ε<sub>0</sub>, etc. Formally, an ordinal is the order-type of a well-ordered set, but you don't really have to worry about the formal definition. Just know that ordinals can be used to create large finite numbers through the use of things like the fast-growing hierarchy!
  </p>

  <p>
    First, this ordinal notation needs an alphabet. An alphabet is simply a set of symbols that terms in this notation are made up of. My ordinal notation consists of different systems, one for each natural number \(N\), and is thus actually a family of ordinal notations intead of just one ordinal notation. Fix a natural number \(N\) (\(0\) is a natural number!), then, in the \(N\)<sup>th</sup> system, the alphabet consists of the following symbols:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>\(0\)</li>
    <li>\()\)</li>
    <li>\(+\)</li>
    <li>\(\psi(\) (yes, this is one symbol)</li>
    <li>\(\Sigma_N\)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Not all terms that can be created by these symbols is an actual term. For example, \())0\Sigma_N+\psi(\) is just non-sense. Because of this, we also have grammar rules for what symbols can be put together to form a term. The set \(T\) will denote the set of all terms in this ordinal notation, while \(PT \subset T\) is a subset of that set that only has terms with a specific property. \(T\) and \(PT\) are defined as follows:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>\(0\) and \(\Sigma_N\) is a term, where \(\Sigma_N\) is a term in \(PT\)</li>
    <li>for two terms \(a\) and \(b\), where \(a \in PT\) and \(b \neq 0\), \(a+b\) is a term</li>
    <li>for a term \(a\), \(\psi(a)\) is a term in \(PT\)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We also need a way to order these terms in \(T\). The order in \(T\) is really simple: terms are ordered in lexicographical order, where \(0 &lt; ) &lt; + &lt; \psi( &lt; \Sigma_N\). I.e. for terms \(a\) and \(b\), if you want to know which one's greater, go from left to right through \(a\) and \(b\) until you find a symbol that is different in \(a\) than in \(b\), and depending on the order of symbols described above, you know which terms larger! For example, \(\psi(\psi(0)) &lt; \psi(\Sigma_N)\) as \(\psi &lt; \Sigma_N\), and that's the first symbol in which they differ. If \(a\) and \(b\) are equal up to a point where one ends, the longer one is simply the greater term: \(\psi(0)+\psi(0) &gt; \psi(0)\).
  </p>

  <p>
    For easier writing, I've made a list of abbreviations! Abbreviations aren't really a necessary part of an ordinal notation, but they could be useful. They're basically a different way of notating terms in the ordinal notation. Here are the abbreviations I'll use:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Let \(\underline{1}\) abbreviate \(\psi(0)\)</li>
    <li>For a natural number \(n &gt; 0\), let \(\underline{1+n}\) abbreviated \(\underline{1}+\underline{n}\)</li>
    <li>Let \(\underline{\omega}\) abbreviate \(\psi(\underline{1})\)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    I distinguish abbreviations from actual notation using an <u>underline</u>. There's also smth somewhat related to abbreviations, so I'll talk about it here :3. For a natural number \(n\), \(\Sigma_n\) can be used as an abbreviation for \(\psi(\Sigma_{n+1})\) in the \(N\)<sup>th</sup> system, where \(N &gt; n\). In the combined system, functions on terms are evaluated as if they're in the \(N\)<sup>th</sup> system where they all terms are valid terms in the \(N\)<sup>th</sup> system. If you don't quite get it, here's an example: in the combined system, \(\psi(\Sigma_2+\Sigma_2) &lt; \psi(\Sigma_3+\Sigma_1)\) will be evaluated in the \(N\)<sup>th</sup> system for some \(N \ge 3\), let's say \(N = 3\). Then, we can evaluate \(\Sigma_2\) and \(\Sigma_1\) using the abbreviations: \(\psi(\psi(\Sigma_3)+\psi(\Sigma_3)) &lt; \psi(\Sigma_3+\psi(\psi(\Sigma_3)))\). We now see that this expression is true in the \(3\)<sup>rd</sup> system, thus the expression \(\psi(\Sigma_2+\Sigma_2) &lt; \psi(\Sigma_3+\Sigma_1)\) is true in the combined system. Does that make sense? I hope it does :3c
  </p>

  <p>
    Let \(\oplus\) be a binary infix function on \(T\). \(\oplus\) is defined as follows:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>\(s \oplus 0 = s\)</li>
    <li>\(s \oplus [a + b] = [s \oplus a] \oplus b\) (I use \([]\) to indicate the order of operations as \(()\) is already part of the syntax)</li>
    <li>\(s \oplus t = t\) for \(t \in PT\) and \(s &lt; t\)</li>
    <li>\(s \oplus t = s + t\) for \(t \in PT\) and \(t \le s\)</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    While \(+\) is part of the syntax, \(\oplus\) can be used to actually sum two terms together.
  </p>

  <p>
    An ordinal notation usually also has a system of fundamental sequences (or sometimes a standardness algorithm). An FS is a sequence leading up to an ordinal and is needed in the definition of the FGH. For example, the fundamental sequence for \(\omega\), the smallest infinite ordinal, is (usually) the sequence \((0,1,2,...)\). The \(\eta\)<sup>th</sup> term of the fundamental sequence of \(\alpha\), with respect to some system of fundamental sequences, is usually denoted \(\alpha [\eta]\). The length of the fundamental sequence of \(\alpha\) is denoted \(\text{dom}(\alpha)\).
  </p>

  <p>
    To define the fundamental sequences, I'll need to define a few other functions. One is a function \(\text{deg}\), mapping terms terms to what degree they have. \(\text{deg}(a) \ge 1\) means that \(a\) represents an admissible ordinal, and \(\text{deg}(a) \ge n+1\) for positive \(n\) means that \(a\) represents a \(\Sigma_n\)-stable ordinal. Another is \(+_{\bullet}\). \(a^{+_n}\) is supposed to represent the next \(\Sigma_n\)-stable ordinal after \(a\). And lastly, I'll also need a ternary \(\Psi\)-function where \(\Psi^a_b(c)\) is the collapse of \(c &lt; a\) below \(b\).
  </p>

\[\begin{array}{rrcl}
\text{dom}: & T & \to & T \\
& a & \mapsto & \text{dom}(a) \\
[]: & T^2 & \to & T \\
& (a,b) & \mapsto & a[b] \\
\text{deg}: & T & \to & \mathbb{N} \\
& a & \mapsto & \text{deg}(a) \\
+_{\bullet}: & T \times \mathbb{N} & \to & T \\
& (a,n) & \mapsto & a^{+_n} \\
\Psi: & T^3 & \to & T \\
& (a,b,c) & \mapsto & \Psi^a_b(c)
\end{array}\]

  <p>
    The definitions of the above functions kind-of all depend on each other, so it gets a bit complicated. I'll start with defining the top-most function and work my way down. Here's the definition of the domain map:
  </p>

  <p>
    \(\text{dom}\) is a mapping from terms \(s\) to terms \(\text{dom}(s)\). Given a term \(s \in T\), \(\text{dom}(s)\) is defined as follows:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Suppose \(s = 0\). Then, \(\text{dom}(s) = 0\).</li>
    <li>Suppose \(s = \Sigma_N\). Then, \(\text{dom}(s) = \Sigma_N\).</li>
    <li>Suppose \(s = a+b\) for some \((a,b) \in PT \times (T \smallsetminus \{ 0 \})\). Then, \(\text{dom}(s) = \text{dom}(b)\).</li>
    <li>Suppose \(s = \psi(a)\) for some \(a \in T\). Then:</li>
    <ol>
      <li>Suppose \(\text{dom}(a) = 0\). Then, \(\text{dom}(s) = \underline{1}\).</li>
      <li>Suppose \(\text{dom}(a) = \underline{1}\). Then, \(\text{dom}(s) = \underline{\omega}\).</li>
      <li>Suppose \(\underline{\omega} \le \text{dom}(a) &lt; s\). Then, \(\text{dom}(s) = \text{dom}(a)\).</li>
      <li>Suppose \(\text{dom}(a) &gt; s\). This is where it gets fun! &gt;:3 First, let \(0 \le n \le N\) be the smallest natural number so that \(s^{+_{n+1}} &gt; \text{dom}(a)\) where \(\psi(a)^{+_{N+1}} &gt; \text{dom}(a)\) is regarded as true. Then:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>If \(n \neq 0\) and [\(\text{dom}(a) = s^{+_n}\) or \(\text{deg}(\text{dom}(a)) \le n\)], then \(\text{dom}(s) = s\).</li>
        <li>Otherwise, \(\text{dom}(s) = \underline{\omega}\). Well, I'd suppose it'd be more fun with the FS map :P</li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
  </ol>

  <p>
    \([]\) is a mapping from pairs of terms \((s,t)\) where \(t &lt; \text{dom}(s)\) to terms \(s[t]\). Given terms \(s\) and \(t\), \(s[t]\) is defined as follows: 
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Suppose \(s = \Sigma_N\). Then, \(s[t] = t\).</li>
    <li>Suppose \(s = a+b\) for some \((a,b) \in PT \times (T \smallsetminus \{ 0 \})\). Then, \(s[t] = a+b[t]\)</li>
    <li>Suppose \(s = \psi(a)\) for some \(a \in T\). Then:</li>
    <ol>
      <li>Suppose \(\text{dom}(a) = 0\). Then, \(s[t] = 0\).</li>
      <li>Suppose \(\text{dom}(a) = \underline{1}\). Then:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Suppose \(t = 0\), then \(s[t] = 0\).</li>
        <li>Suppose \(t = \underline{1}\), then \(s[t] = \psi(a[0])\).</li>
        <li>Suppose \(t = \underline{1+n}\) for some positive natural \(n\), then \(s[t] = s[\underline{1}]+s[\underline{n}]\).</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Suppose \(\omega \le \text{dom}(a) &lt; s\). Then, \(s[t] = \psi(a[t])\).</li>
      <li>Suppose \(\text{dom}(a) &gt; s\). Let \(0 \le n \le N\) be the smallest natural number so that \(s^{+_{n+1}} &gt; \text{dom}(a)\) where \(s^{+_{N+1}} &gt; \text{dom}(a)\) is regarded as true. Then:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>If \(n \neq 0\) and [\(\text{dom}(a) = s^{+_n}\) or \(\text{deg}(\text{dom}(a)) \le n\)], then \(s[t] = t\).</li>
        <li>Otherwise, \(s[t] = \lambda(t)\) where \(\lambda(0) = 0\) and \(\lambda(\underline{1+k}) = a[\Psi^a_{\text{dom}(a)}(\lambda(n))]\).</li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
  </ol>

    Wasn't that fun!

    <ol>
      <li>Suppose \(\text{dom}(a) &lt; s\). Then, \(\text{deg}(s) = 0\).</li>
      <li>Otherwise, let \(0 \le n \le N\) be the least natural number so that \(s^{+_{n+1}} &gt; \text{dom}(a)\). Then:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>If \(n \neq 0\) and [\(\text{dom}(a) = s^{+_n}\) or \(\text{deg}(\text{dom}(a)) \le n\)], then \(\text{deg}(s) = \text{deg}(\text{dom}(a))\).</li>
        <li>Otherwise, \(\text{deg}(s) = 0\).</li>

  <ol>
    <li>If \(n = N\) then \(\psi(a)^{+_n} = \Sigma_N\).</li>
    <li>Otherwise, \(\psi(a)^{+_n} = \psi(a \oplus \psi(a)^{+_{n+1}})\).</li>
