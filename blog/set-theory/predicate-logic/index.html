  <h1>Introduction to Predicate Logic</h1>

  <p>
    Hia everyone! I hope you're all having a wonderfull day. This is the first blog-post in my series of blog-posts about set-theory! This blog-post isn't <i>really</i> about set theory, but is rather an introduction to predicate logic and its notation.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>(why)</b> Now, when reading this blog-post, you might be asking "why do we need all these fancy notations when plain English does just fine?" This has two main answers: (1) this notation is unambiguous and (2) this notation is faster to write, but feel free to just use plain English everywhere if you like!
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>(what)</b> Predicate logic, aka first order logic, is a form of logic that has logical connectives (things like "a AND b", "NOT a", etc) and quantifiers ("FORALL x, a" and "THERE EXISTS an x for which a"). In this short blog-post, I'll learn you what all the different symbols are and what they mean (&wedge;, &not;, &forall;, etc), what the order of precedence is (e.g. how to interpret "a and b or c": "(a and b) or c" or "a and (b or c)"?), what proofs are and how to write them.
  </p>

  <p>
    First, we'll start with the simplest two symbols: &top; representing a constant TRUE, and &UpTee; representing a constant FALSE. We can insert these two symbols in English sentences, e.g. "if the sky is blue then &UpTee;". At the time of writing this, the sky is blue, so is that sentence true or false?<sup>1</sup> I'm not going to spoil the answer ofc :p. /j, the sentence is false: if it were be true, and because the sky is currently blue, &UpTee; must be true, but it isn't, because &UpTee; is by definition false. Another example is "either &top; or (not &top;) is true", is this true?

    I got bored... I might finish this blog-post later.
