  <h1>Elliptic Curves (Work in progress!)</h1>

  <a href="../..">&leftarrow; DV103</a>

  <p>
    Hai again! I wanted to understand one of the Millennium Prize Problems. I have chosen the Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture as the problem I will try to understand. From what I understand so far, the Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture concerns rational points on elliptic curves. I currently don't understand much of the problem, but once I understand more about it I'll try to explain it as well as I can!
