<h1>DV103</h1>

<p>Heyy. &#x2727; I'm DV103, she/her. I like maths, music, yuri, games, drawing and programming. I'm a 17yo transfem and sometimes like to share my interests here.</p>

<p>In maths, I started with set theory and logic, but lately I'm trying out other fields as well. I sometimes write blogs about what I find, here, or on my Tumblr. My favourite number is $\mathfrak{d}$. It's called the <a>dominating number</a>, it's defined as the minimal number of functions on $\mathbb{N}$ needed to eventually surpass all other functions. In symbols, $\mathfrak{d} := \min \{ \# S \mid S \subset \mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}} \wedge \forall f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \  \exists g \in S \  \forall^{\infty} n. f(n) \le g(n) \}$.</p>

<p>I like to listen to music by Patricia Taxxon, Porter Robinson, HOME and YonKaGor. Here are some songs I like:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vomxeH3uXGQ">With My Tail to the World · Patricia Taxxon</a> This is the first song I've heard of her, a friend shared it with me in January.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjKLjGbL-W0">Circus Hop · YonKaGor</a> (°&lt;°)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2TE0DjdNqI">Goodbye To A World · Porter Robinson</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4Jyev7iTlE">Head First · HOME</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdatjEQ6fV0">weka sina · Tanger, jan Mika &amp; stimkitten</a> It's in Toki Pona, I don't understand it.</li>
</ul>

<p>As for games, I like Celeste, some visual novels like Bad End Theater and We Know The Devil, rhythm games (GD and JSAB), and I like Minecraft, but only modded Minecraft. I got Celeste for my birthday some years ago. I'd played to chapter 5 but forgot about it. I picked it up again some time ago and now have 183 storbies.</p>

<p>I don't draw that often. I'm not really that good at it. I want to become better at it, but I often don't have inspiration for what to draw. I might share some of my drawings online once I'm a bit better at it. For now, have this fish &lt;&gt;&lt;</p>

<p>I like programming. I often program games, my favourite game I've made is <a href="https://replit.com/@DaVinci103/p5js">Je Moeder's Oma's Tweede Verjaardag</a> (I often don't know how I should name my games :P), I really want to make a remake of it as I like the concept and I see a lot of ways it can still be improved.</p>

<p>Here's a list of my blogs on this site:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="blog/strong-N-shiftedness">Strong N-Shiftedness</a></li>
<li><a href="blog/god-angel-game">God-Angel Game</a></li>
<li><a href="blog/set-theory">Introduction to Set Theory</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I hope you have a nice day! .(&DiacriticalDot;&breve;&DiacriticalDot;)&sol;</p>
