    I'm a demi-girl and I use she/they pronouns... I think, I haven't really figured all this out yet.

    In mathematics, I'm mostly interested in the foundations of mathematics, set theory and ordinal analysis. My favourite number is \(\mathfrak{d}\), the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_characteristic_of_the_continuum#Bounding_number_and_dominating_number">dominating number</a>! (are infinities allowed?) The dominating number is a cardinal characteristic of the continuum: it lies between the second smallest infinite cardinal number, \(\aleph_1\), and the continuum, \(\mathfrak{c}\).

    I like music a lot. My favourite must artist is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3iL1s104mOH8q7iQYDiesg">YonKaGor</a>! (&deg;&lt;&deg;) I also really like the music of Randy Goffe, aka <a href="https://soundcloud.com/home-2001">HOME</a>. I would list the music genres I like if I knew the names of any of them, but I don't :P
  </p>

  <p>
    My favourite game is Celeste! I got the game a few years ago for my birthday, but I got stuck in chapter 5 and didn't play it until recently. I really like this game because of the difficult platforming, the music and the story! I also like visual novels, my favourite game used to be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1764390/BAD_END_THEATER/">Bad End Theater</a> by NomNomNami. I also really like rhythm games! I sometimes make levels in Geometry Dash, a rhythm game by RobTop.

    I don't draw that often and I'm not really that good at it. I want to become better at it, but I often don't have inspiration for what to draw. I might share some of my drawings online once I'm a bit better at drawing :3
  </p>

  <p>
    I like programming. I often program games, my favourite game I've made is <a href="https://replit.com/@DaVinci103/p5js">Je Moeder's Oma's Tweede Verjaardag</a> (I often don't know how I should name my games :P), I really want to make a remake of it as I like the concept and I see a lot of ways it can still be improved.
