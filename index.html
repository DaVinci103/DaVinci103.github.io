    Heya! &#x2740; I'm DV103. Things I like include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>&prurel; Mathematics &#x22b1;</li>
    <li>&#x266b; Music &#x266b;</li>
    <li>&#x2727; Drawing &#x2727;</li>
    <li>&#x2b26; Programming &#x2b26;</li>
    <li>&#x1f658; Gaming &#x1f65b;</li>
  </ul>

    In the field of mathematics, I'm mostly interested in the foundations of mathematics, set theory and ordinal analysis. My favourite number is &dfr;, the <i>dominating number</i>! (are infinite numbers allowed?) The dominating number is a cardinal characteristic of the continuum: it lies between the second least infinite cardinal number (a cardinal number measures how many elements are in a set), &aleph;<sub>1</sub>, and the continuum, &cfr; (the cardinality of the set of real numbers). &Nopf; &rightarrow; &Nopf; denotes the set of functions from natural numbers to natural numbers. Functions f, g: &Nopf; &rightarrow; &Nopf; can be compared using &leq;*: f &leq;* g iff there exists a natural number N so that, for all n &gt; N, f(n) &leq; g(n). The dominating number is the size of the smallest set of functions F so that, for all f: &Nopf; &rightarrow; &Nopf;, there is some g &isinv; F so that f &leq;* g.

    (this isn't the full list, I'll update it later)
  </p>

    I don't play games often, so the list of games I like is much smaller than the list of music artists. Because of this, I've decided to explain in more detail what these games are. The list is currently still incomplete.
  </p>

  <p>
    My favourite game is <i>Bad End Theater</i> by NomnomNami. Bad End Theater is a visual novel made with Ren'Py about a theater with... bad ends. I don't want to spoil to much so you just have to play it yourself. I can say that is has a gay love story. I'd found out it existed a few years ago but haven't actually played it until recently.
